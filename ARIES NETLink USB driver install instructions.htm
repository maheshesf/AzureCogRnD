        <p>Installing USB drivers for ARIES NETLink on Microsoft Windows XP, 7, 8.1 or 10:</p>
    </div>
	<div>
	    <blockquote>
	        <ol>
	            <li>With the software installed on your computer, use Windows Explorer to locate
					the USB driver by browsing to the location where the software was installed.<br>
					Example: C:\Kidde Fire Systems\Firmware Upgrade Utility ARIES and ARIES NETLink\Drivers\Panel\MLIC</li>
				<li>Locate the compressed USB driver file that has a name which corresponds to your
					computer hardware and operating system. For example, the "MLIC_WIN8_64"
					driver is for a 64-bit computer running Windows 8.1.</li>
	            <li>Extract the contents of the compressed driver file to a temporary folder that you create.
					For example: C:\Temp\MLIC. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Make a note of the folder location for
					later use.</span><br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> It is recommended that all devices attached to your computer are installed
					properly (i.e. no yellow exclamation marks are next to any devices in Device
					Manager).</li>
	            <li>Power on the ARIES NETLink control unit and, after 30 seconds, connect it to your
					computer using an USB A-to-B type cable.</li>
	            <li>Windows may attempt to automatically install the driver but will not be successful.
					When it fails or, if it does not attempt to automatically install the driver, open the
					Device Manager.</li>
	            <li>In Device Manager, locate the entry under "Other devices" entitled "Unknown device" or "MLICUSBSerial".
					If there are multiple such entries, follow the instructions in the next step
					to find the correct one. Otherwise, skip the next two steps.</li>
				<li>To identify the correct "Unknown device", right-click on the device, and select
					"Properties". Click on the "Details" tab and from "Property", select "Hardware IDs". The
					correct device will have the following value:
					"USB\VID_03EB&amp;PID_6119&amp;REV_0100"</li>
				<li>If you cannot find an entry that has the proper values (specified in the prior step),
					then either you have: 1) a prior version of the driver installed, or 2) you should
					unplug, reboot your computer, and replug the USB cable and see if the entry shows
					up. If the latter doesn't work: perform the steps in the section entitled:
					<span style="font-style: italic;">"Uninstalling the USB Driver"</span>, and then restart
					this section.</li>
				<li>With the correct "Unknown device" identified, right-click on it, and select "Properties".</li>
				<li>Select the Driver tab, and click "Update Driver...".</li>
				<li>An "Update Driver Software" screen opens. Click "Browse my computer for driver software".</li>
				<li>Click the &lt;Browse&gt; button and go to the location that the extracted USB driver file
					was saved to in Step 3. Click &lt;Next&gt;.</li>
				<li>Windows will prompt you to proceed. Click "Install this driver software anyway".</li>
				<li>At the end of the installation, you should see a prompt indicating that "Windows has
					successfully updated your driver software". Click &lt;Close&gt; to close Device Manager.
					If installation fails, please consult Kidde Technical Support.</li>
				<li>Reboot your computer after installing the driver.</li>
				<li>To validate that the drivers are installed properly, perform the steps in the section
					entitled: <span style="font-style: italic;">"Verifying the Installation of the USB Drivers"</span>.</li>

	    <blockquote>
	        <ol>
	            <li>With the ARIES NETLink control unit powered on and connected to your computer with the
					USB cable, open Device Manager.</li>
				<li>Expand the "Ports (COM &amp; LPT)" entry.</li>
				<li>If you see a "MLIC (COM##)" entry without a yellow exclamation point, the driver
					is installed properly. Skip the following steps.</li>
				<li>If you don't see a "MLIC (COM##)" entry, expand the "Other devices" entry to see
					if there is an "Unknown device" entry. If there is not, remove the USB cable and
					reboot your computer. After rebooting, reconnect the USB cable, open Device
					Manager, and see if either "MLIC (COM##)" or "Unknown device" appears. If it does
					not appear, you likely have a prior version of the driver installed. Follow the
					instructions in the section entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">"Uninstalling the USB Driver"</span>.</li>
				<li>If you see an "Unknown Device" entry under "Other devices", follow the steps in the
					section entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">"Installing USB Drivers for ARIES NETLink on Microsoft Windows XP, 7, 8.1 or 10"</span>,
					and then repeat this section.</li>
				<li>If you see a "MLIC (COM##)" entry with a yellow exclamation mark next to it, then
					the driver isn't installed properly. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A yellow exclamation mark indicates an
					error with the driver installation.</span> Follow the instructions in the sections entitled:
					<span style="font-style: italic;">"Uninstalling the USB Driver",
